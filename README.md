This tutorial focuses on the essential aspect of contributing to open-source, the GitHub pull request workflow.
Many projects follow similar setups we cover, and expects contributions to their repositories in the form of pull requests,
whether it is the addition of new code, fixing bugs or contributing to the documentation.


For further read about some open-source contributing workflows see any of the following for astropy, scikit-learn, or numpy:
* [walked through example of a bug fix PR in astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/git_edit_workflow_examples.html#astropy-fix-example),
* [developer documentation of the astropy core library](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation) starting with the ["How to make a code contribution"](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html) page,
* [crash course in contributing to open source](https://sites.google.com/view/nyc-2020-scikit-sprint) material presented at a scikit-learn sprint
* [contributing to NumPy](https://numpy.org/contribute/) with [guides for code contributions](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#development-process-summary).
